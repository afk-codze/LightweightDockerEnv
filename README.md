# LightweightDockerEnv
A lightweight container runtime, It offers the core essentials of Docker-like functionalities with an emphasis on process isolation through PID namespaces.


## **Potential Technical Improvements:**

**1. Layer Download Optimization:** The current approach waits for traffic redirection before initiating the download of Docker Layers, as URLs constructed from digests in image manifests often necessitate redirection. A more efficient mechanism could directly assess if a layer's URL is immediately accessible and, if so, bypass redirection altogether for faster retrieval.

**2. Enhanced Filesystem Mounting:** Introducing mounting of essential filesystems like /proc inside the new root can prove beneficial. Many system utilities, such as ps and top, rely heavily on /proc. Moreover, to accommodate Docker images that require access to specialized device interfaces, mounting /dev could be implemented.

**3. Incorporating the Configuration Blob:** Including the configuration blob directly within the filesystem could be explored. This blob, found in image manifests, is a JSON structure containing valuable metadata about the Docker image. It encompasses details like default commands, environment variable settings, and other Docker-centric specifications.

**4. Transitioning Root for Security:** While chroot is currently employed, considering a shift to pivot_root may bolster security. This transition would address potential vulnerabilities that can arise with chroot, offering a more secure container runtime environment.
